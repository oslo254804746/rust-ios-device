# Quality review and release readiness

Review monthly and after releases or important protocol/dependency changes.
When cadence changes, record the reason and next review date; retain previous
conclusions. This template starts D02 governance, not 1.0 readiness or release
authorization. The roadmap retains every unfinished task and subtask.

Current implementation review: 2026-10-01. Monthly review remains planned for 2026-10-30.
The [capability catalog](capabilities.md) is the source for maturity/evidence;
[build evidence](validation/build-release-2026-09-30.md) records the first gate.

| Measure | Current evidence | Remaining condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Indexed CLI/service surfaces | 62 commands and 49 service families | CI checks drift against source and actual help |
| Stable device workflows | No current capability certified stable | Representative device PASS with scope and exact commit |
| Host build/tests | [Q02 regression gate](validation/regression-runner-2026-10-01.md), `e9cc536`, 1651 Rust/eight Python, 34 tooling tests, 38 raw CLI/service cases and five regression host cases; prior TLS/browser evidence retained | 22 real-device matrix rows NOT_RUN; device adapters/fixtures, Windows process tree/ACL/UNC, F05 entries, deployed transport, orderly Apple cleanup and other platforms remain unfinished |
| Platform release candidates | Linux x86_64 validated | macOS, Windows, ARM Linux runner results |
| Post-release regression | NOT_RUN | No release made by this implementation |
| Critical p50/p95 latency and throughput | NOT_RUN | L04 reproducible before/after baseline |
| Resource release and bounded long-run checks | Debug host revocation/ownership fixtures PASS; bounded long-run NOT_RUN | Orderly device cleanup, L02/L03 fixtures and L04 sampling |
| Public compatibility contract | Pending | A01/A02 Rust/CLI/C/Python ownership, errors, cancellation and migration |
| 1.0 candidate workflow matrix | NOT_RUN | Cross-platform/device automation and long-run evidence |

Each review must record tested commits, host/device/iOS/transport/state, exact
commands, PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE/NOT_RUN, accessible sanitized evidence, changes
to compatibility, and next actions. Percentages must state their denominator;
unknown or NOT_RUN conditions cannot count as passing coverage. Performance
budgets follow measured baselines, not invented throughput or delay promises.

1.0 candidate entry criteria: explicit candidate APIs/commands/JSON formats;
error/ownership/cancellation/migration contracts for every proposed stable
interface; verified release gates and artifacts; at least one representative
platform/device workflow regression and bounded long-run check. Experimental
CDP, Cryptex, media, clipboard and restore boundaries remain separately listed.
Meeting these criteria does not automatically publish anything or complete the
remaining roadmap features. Choose an unused release version consistently
before registry packaging; do not overwrite already-published 0.1.13.
