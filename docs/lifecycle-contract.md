# Deadlines, cancellation and connection state

L01/class 4 is in progress. The DTX profile's accepted implementation is
`940c4c673e7fe023503b97197777354c7f44e253`; the FPS owner profile is
`dcec5a2032f2994ed45678cb838447607abee65b`; AFC request/file ownership is
`c4b471d33b1260736a295e8718d3c47ee6562165`; the internal H2 framer profile is
`ddd3620f058c6c23649a083d209dceb41f0eb472`. This contract records implemented profiles and
their limits; it does not certify every service or remote cleanup.

| Deadline role | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Connect | Transport, discovery/bootstrap or service setup budget; each documented entry owns its start point |
| Request | One send/reply operation, including protocol flow-control and unrelated messages/ACKs |
| Total operation | Shared absolute budget across explicitly participating stages; separate per-stage timers do not establish this |
| Idle | Waiting for a complete next event. Empty idle expiry can be an ordinary listener outcome; a partial frame is different |
| Cleanup | A separately bounded stop/close/join budget; failure must retain any earlier primary operation failure |

InstallCoordination's existing query profile shares send/receive budget and
invalidates an uncorrelated request after I/O begins. DTX now has a corresponding
local state profile; other protocols/owners still need their own implementation
and acceptance. Existing service defaults are not globally replaced here.

`ios_core::dtx::DtxConnection` adds request_channel_with_timeout,
method_call_with_timeout and recv_with_timeout. They use one absolute cooperative
Tokio deadline for the entire operation; notification/ACK traffic does not reset
it. Zero budget returns a source-free timeout without polling the operation,
changing identifiers or sending bytes. Unrepresentable budgets return typed
input errors. Actual timer expiry retains Tokio Elapsed in existing DtxError::Io.
Legacy entry points keep their existing unbounded timing profile.

Existing public DTX I/O operations own a guard and is_usable reports local state.
A completed transport/codec error makes the connection unusable. Cancellation
after any reported read/write bytes also invalidates it and clears pending
replies, live-message backlog, outstanding IDs, fragments and retained-byte
accounting. All later operations reject before I/O; reconnect with a new
transport. The transport stays owned until the client is dropped. No remote ACK,
shutdown completion, rollback or safe retry is implied.

A cancelled zero-byte wait keeps framing/correlation intact and remains usable.
This preserves normal idle polling. Dropping an unpolled future also leaves the
connection untouched. Successful complete operations remain reusable; a service
business error parsed after a complete DTX message is outside the codec guard.
The standalone read_dtx_frame helper has no connection guard; its caller owns
cancellation/reassembly policy.

CoreProfile's 500 ms optional initial notice wait still accepts an empty idle
slot. Accessibility's 300 ms initial slots and focus idle wait retain their
empty-idle outcomes. A partial frame timeout now fails immediately with original
Elapsed rather than returning success/None for an unusable connection. Channel
selection, event filtering, ordering and successful serialization stay.

Host fixtures and limits: [DTX lifecycle gate](validation/dtx-lifecycle-2026-10-04.md).
Compatibility: [public contract](public-contract.md); classification/effects:
[error contract](error-contract.md).

FPS capture owns the session/read future directly, without an event queue or
background reader. A sample tick preserves an in-flight partial read; operator
stop and an already due absolute window take priority over ready events.
Setup shares 30 seconds across service connect/CoreProfile connect/start after
the outer device resolver. stop has a separate five-second cleanup budget.
Timestamp retention is capped at 262,144 per window; the next record fails with
a CLI resource_limit decision. The additive iterator avoids another collection;
the legacy Vec parser remains uncapped and compatible.

Cleanup after success can fail; after a primary failure both original errors
remain owned and the primary drives the final category. Count/stop during a
partial read can invalidate DTX and make cleanup fail. Whole-future cancellation
drops transport without async stop or a detached reader. Successful stop is a
wire write, not an ACK. Synchronous output/decoding cannot be interrupted by a
Tokio timer. See [FPS host fixtures and migration](validation/fps-lifecycle-2026-10-04.md).

AfcClient has a shared send/flush/reply guard at every request site. Optional
set_request_timeout(Some(budget)) uses one absolute per-request budget; default
None retains legacy unbounded request timing. Zero/unrepresentable deadlines
reject before I/O, actual expiry retains Elapsed in IO.get_ref. Cancelled
zero-byte requests remain usable; completed IO/codec errors and cancellation
after bytes reject reuse. Complete ordinary Status errors preserve framing.
is_usable also reports automatic file-helper ownership; it is not a remote ACK.

Automatic reads/writes attempt file close after returned operation failure and
success, with an independent five-second budget (or a shorter configured request
budget). Failed close or transfer cancellation after open requires a fresh
transport, including cancellation between requests while waiting for a host
reader. Dual failure keeps original primary and cleanup objects; the primary
drives classification. Drop does not await close, manually opened handles remain
caller-owned, and borrowed raw transports must not bypass invalid state. Existing
packet-number acceptance and frame/whole-file limits remain. See
[AFC fixture boundaries and migration](validation/afc-lifecycle-2026-10-04.md).

H2Framer guards its frame I/O entries and the borrowed finish-connect stage.
Cancellation after reported bytes, transport errors and native EOF invalidate
local framing, clear retained H2 buffers/queues/accounting and reject further
framer I/O. The handle stays owned until Drop; borrowed transports must not
bypass this state. Zero-byte cancellation/expiry and unpolled futures remain
usable. Completed stream-local reset/EOF/GOAWAY keep their previous isolation.

Internal set_operation_timeout configures one absolute budget across a framer
operation's HEADERS/DATA/flush/flow-control reads. Default None and all current
production callers retain unbounded framer timing. This adds no public raw-H2
export or frontend option, connect budget, whole XPC-call deadline or async
cleanup. The held operation future is boxed before the timeout wrapper to keep
nested service/bootstrap futures within the existing CLI stack test. It is
still owned directly, without a background reader/task.

The upper XPC layer still needs guards after consuming a wrapper header, while
waiting after a sent request, and around pending replies/stream/file ownership.
Those boundaries cannot be inferred from the H2 byte guard. See
[H2 fixtures and limits](validation/h2-lifecycle-2026-10-04.md).

Remaining L01 work includes other service/protocol deadlines and cancellation
state, cleanup-primary retention and bounded stream/task ownership for other clients,
and late/fragmented/blocked-send cases for each owner. L02–L04/Q04 and platform/
device evidence remain separate tasks. A local category or is_usable value is
not evidence of device recovery or remote cleanup.
